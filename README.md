## Getting Started

This app requires [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) and a package manager like [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) to run.

For the very first startup run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

- or -

npm install
npm run build
npm start

# or your prefered package managers equivalent.
```

Each startup afterwards only requires:

```bash
npm run dev

- or -

npm start

# or your prefered package managers equivalent.
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

## Disclaimer

This app was mostly written to tinker around with NextJS and TailwindCSS. Maybe someday i'll convert it into an electron app or similar.
